# Fiid Match & Win Memory Game

## Code Institute MS2 Project in Interactive Frontend Development 
The brief was to develop an interactive front-end site which responds to the users' actions, allowing them to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals. This website is created for educational purposes.

## [Fiid Match & Win Memory Game](https://natashaclerkin.github.io/fiid-memory-game-MS2/) 

Irish plant-based food B2C company, Fiid, are looking to further brand awareness and increase customer acquisition. They would like to drive sales by creating a timed memory game for users to win discount code for their next online purchase. The user has to match two of each product type before the time runs out. If they are successful, they are able to subscribe to earn a discount code which will be valid for their next purchase. Users have the ability to share the game with their followers on social media. The target audience are health-conscious individuals, particularly the millennial bracket who like games and discounts. 

The primary goal of the main Fiid website is to inform and direct users to place an order. I wanted to create an experience that integrates with their main website. This would include instructions on how the game works, how to obtain the discount code through a short signup form and how they can spread the word through social media. There would also be links to the company's social media channels and most importantly the main online store. This would allow users to learn more about the products, place an order or share the game with their followers on their own channels.

The opportunity to win a discount code incentivizes participation aswell as increasing brand recognition and follower engagement. In order to obtain the discount code, the user has to register through an entry form for lead generation and simultaneously allows the user to sign up to the newsletter. The concept is to offer a discount to all registered users in order to convert them into paying customers.


**The business goals of this website are:**

- To market the current offering of Fiid products.
- Increase customer acquisition.
- To increase brand recognition and follower engagement. 
- Make the brand stand out from the swarm of plant-based companies during Veganuary 
- Target a younger audience who have more disposible income such as millennials.

**The customer goals of this website are:**

- Learn about the product offering
- Obtain a discount towards future orders
- Have a good experience while on the site


# UX

### Strategy
It's vital as a B2C company to stand out amongst the competition because the B2C space is crowded with competitors. Most users will make their purchase on one of their first few visits so it is so important to grab the user and keep them on the site long enough to place the order. Compelling but minimal text accompanied by lots of imagery is required to keep the user engaged. 
As the memory game is a huge part of the customer acquisition process, it has to be developed to a high standard and respond correctly to the user's interactions. The overall game will be simple enough for the user to complete in order to reward them for their time and encourage them to place an order.  

#### Ideal users of this website:
- Vegan/health-conscious individuals
- Working adults who are looking for convenient meal products for themselves or their families 
- Millennials

#### These users are looking for:
- Discounts
- Quality, healthy and convenient products
- Hassle-free ordering

#### This project is the best way to achieve their goals because:
The market is saturated with plant-based products and the user wants a quality product at a discounted price. The short game makes the company stand out from the crowd and rewards the user if they can remember the brand's offering.

#### User Stories
 
1. **_As a new visitor to the website,_** I want to find out about the products on offer and why I should purchase from the company as opposed to similar brands so that I can potentially become a customer. 

2. **_As a regular customer of the brand,_** I want to be rewarded for my loyalty so that I can receive discounts/offers on future orders and remain a loyal customer.  

3. **_As a user on the site,_** I want to have an enjoyable and hassle-free experience so that I can potentially place an order.

### Scope
To achieve the strategic goals, I wanted to include the following features in this production release:

- Simple and short signup form
- Nav bar with minimal content - i.e. just social media links and link to main site
- Simplistic timed memory game using JavaScript - including countdown and flip counter

### Structure 
The user will be presented with a short, simple user-friendly game leaving them with an enjoyable experience, a lasting memory of the 4 products and hopefully a discount to use at the checkout.
 
### Skeleton
- [Wireframes](assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf "Fiid Wireframes"): The project contains the instructions screen, the game screen, gameover screen and win screen.
**Please note the finalised project contains slight variations to the original wireframe**

### Surface 
As a B2C company, sales are emotionally driven and often as an impulse buy. Branding is a huge factor and emotional triggers lead a customer to purchase a product. It was important to build the memory game on a page that reflected the brand and their product offering. The monochrome colour scheme was implemented along with pops of green to reflect the healthy and fresh products.
The banner assets of fresh produce and company typography was also implemented to integrate the game page as part of the brand and propel the user towards the shop after completion.

## Validation
I used the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the Markup and [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check the CSS validity and [JS Hint Validator](https://jshint.com/) to check the JS rules of the project. After fixing the errors on all testing sites, the sites eventually passed validation.

![alt text](assets/wireframes/css-validation.PNG "CSS Validation Final Results")

![alt text](assets/wireframes/js-validation.PNG "JS Validation Final Results")

The [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/) was used to test for colour contrast on the project.

![alt text](assets/wireframes/color-validation-1.PNG "Color Validation Initial Results")

I found one of the original green shades used for the buttons wasn't working from an accessibility standpoint. I used the contrast testing feature to choose a hex color that would pass the validation tests.

![alt text](assets/wireframes/color-validation-2.PNG "Color Validation Testing")

When I decided on the final shade, I re-ran the tests confirming no further colour contasting issues to be found and the overall site complies with accessibility standards.

![alt text](assets/wireframes/color-validation-3.PNG "Color Validation Final Results")


In order to have optimal user experience, the site needs to be accessible. I would continually run the URL through **WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool** to highlight potential issues. I continued until no further errors or alerts were given.

![alt text](assets/wireframes/wave-validation-1.PNG "Wave Accessibility Test results")

I constantly tested the code in [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and often ran Lighthouse audits to identify and fix issues that affected the site's performance, accessibility and user experience. 

![alt text](assets/wireframes/lighthouse-audit-1.PNG "Lighthouse Testing Initial Results")

This highlighted areas that require improvement for validation. For example, Accessibility issues pointed to areas such as inadequate color contrast ratio which I tested and fixed in **Color Contrast Accessibility Validator**.
Also, a Cross-Origin security issue pertaining to Best Practices was simply resolved via adding `rel= noreferrer` to external links. I also ensured all the necessary aria labels, alt tags etc were present to conform to best practices. 
Through constant testing, I was able to achieve almost 100% on all metrics for optimum Performance, Accessibility, SEO and Best Practices.  

![alt text](assets/wireframes/lighthouse-audit-2.PNG "Lighthouse Testing Final Run Results")

I asked my family, friends and fellow students to test their site on different devices to locate potential bugs. The website was tested over multiple devices (iPhone 5, 6, 11: Safari and Chrome, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) and many browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) to guarantee responsive behaviour and compatibility.  



# Deployment
