## [Fiid Memory Game](https://natashaclerkin.github.io/XXXXXXXX/) 

Irish plant-based food B2C company, Fiid, are looking to further brand awareness and increase customer acquisition. They would like to drive sales by creating a timed Memory game for users to win discount code for their next online purchase. The user has to match 3 of each product type before the time runs out. If they are successful, they earn a discount code which will be valid for their next purchase. Users have the ability to share their result/game on social media. The target audience are health-conscious individuals, particularly the millennial bracket who like games and discounts. 

The primary goal of the main Fiid website is to inform and direct users to place an order. I wanted to implement a page on their website that featured a short sign up form to the memory game, links to their social media channels and most importantly the main online store. This would allow users to learn more about the products, place an order or share the result from the game to their followers on their own channels.

The opportunity to win a discount code incentivizes participation aswell as increasing brand recognition and follower engagement. In order to enter the prize draw, the user has to register through an entry form for lead generation and simultaneously allows the user to sign up to the newsletter. The concept is to offer a discount to all registered users in order to convert them into paying customers.


**The business goals of this website are:**

- To market the current offering of Fiid products.
- Increase customer acquisition.
- To increase brand recognition and follower engagement. 
- Make the brand stand out from the swarm of plant-based companies during Veganuary 
- Target a younger audience who have more disposible income such as millennials.

**The customer goals of this website are:**

- Learn about the product offering
- Obtain a discount towards future orders
- Have a good experience while on the site


# UX

### Strategy
It's vital as a B2C company to stand out amongst the competition because the B2C space is crowded with competitors. Most users will make their purchase on one of their first few visits so it is so important to grab the user and keep them on the site long enough to place the order. Compelling but minimal text accompanied by lots of imagery is required to keep the user engaged. 
As the memory game is a huge part of the customer acquisition process, it has to be developed to a high standard and respond correctly to the user's interactions. The overall game will be simple enough for the user to complete in order to reward them for their time and encourage them to place an order.  

#### Ideal users of this website:
- Vegan/health-conscious individuals
- Working adults who are looking for convenient meal products for themselves or their families 
- Millennials

#### These users are looking for:
- Discounts
- Quality, healthy and convenient products
- Hassle-free ordering

#### This project is the best way to achieve their goals because:
The market is saturated with plant-based products and the user wants a quality product at a discounted price. The short game makes the company stand out from the crowd and rewards the user if they can remember the brand's offering.

#### User Stories
 
1. **_As a new visitor to the website,_** I want to find out about the products on offer and why I should purchase from the company as opposed to similar brands so that I can potentially become a customer. 

2. **_As a regular customer of the brand,_** I want to be rewarded for my loyalty so that I can receive discounts/offers on future orders and remain a loyal customer.  

3. **_As a user on the site,_** I want to have an enjoyable and hassle-free experience so that I can potentially place an order.

### Scope
To achieve the strategic goals, I wanted to include the following features in this production release:

- Simple and short signup form
- Nav bar with minimar content - i.e. just social media links and link to main site
- Simplistic timed memory game using JavaScript - including countdown and match counter

### Structure 
The user will be presented with a short, simple user-friendly game leaving them with an enjoyable experience, a lasting memory of the 4 products and hopefully a discount to use at the checkout.
 
### Skeleton
- [Wireframes](assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf "Fiid Wireframes"): Website contains
**Please note the finalised website contains slight variations to the original wireframe**

### Surface 
As a B2C company, sales are emotionally driven and often as an impulse buy. Branding is a huge factor and emotional triggers lead a customer to purchase a product. It was important to build the memory game on a page that reflected the brand and their product offering. The monochrome colour scheme was implemented along with pops of green to reflect the healthy and fresh products.
The banner assets of fresh produce and company typography was also implemented to integrate the game page as part of the brand and propel the user towards the shop after completion.
